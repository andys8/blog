title: Functional Reactive Programming with `reflex`
---

There has been a lot of excitement about Functional Reactive Programming (FRP) in recent years.
Most of it has been about distant relatives of the original idea, which are nowhere near as powerful or as useful.

The [`reflex`](https://github.com/reflex-frp) library is probably the most ready-to-use of the FRP libraries that get close to the original idea.
It is being actively developed and has a focus on performance, composability and correctness.

There is a lot of focus on using `reflex` for front-end development via GHCJS, but it can also be used in a lot of other domains to great effect.

This project has two main goals:

- working to improve the documentation and educational materials for using `reflex`
- working on code that applies `reflex` in areas where it is likely to have a significant impact

## The basics of `reflex`

If you're new to FRP or to `reflex`, we're working on a series of posts to help get you started:

- [An introduction to `reflex`](../../posts/reflex/basics/introduction/)
- [`Event`s](../../posts/reflex/basics/events/)
- [`Behavior`s](../../posts/reflex/basics/behaviors/)
- [`Dynamic`s](../../posts/reflex/basics/dynamics/)
- [Working with the `DOM`](../../posts/reflex/basics/dom/)
- [Switching](../../posts/reflex/basics/switching/)
